- Overview: This project uses supply chain data from the company DataCo Global. This DataFrame represents data related to orders, including payment information, shipping details, and product information. It has a total of 53 columns and 180,519 rows of data. We hope to take a deeper look into the product categories and the logistics of the delivery process.
    - Data Type - Structured Data: This dataset is available in the form of a CSV file named "DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv." I
    - Areas of Registered Activities: The dataset covers various areas of supply chain activities, including Customer and Order Info, Sales, Delivery and Commercial Distribution. This broad coverage allows for a comprehensive analysis of supply chain processes and performance.
    - Products: The dataset includes information about different types of products, such as Clothing, Sports, and Electronic Supplies. This diversity in product categories could be valuable for studying how different product types interact within the supply chain.
